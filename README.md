This Python script appears to simulate a scenario where a driver's speed and alcohol levels are tested, and tickets are issued accordingly. Here are the main capabilities of the code:

1. User Interaction: It prompts the user to input their name, speed, and alcohol level.

2. Datetime Handling: It imports the datetime module to capture the current date and time.

3. Speed Limit Function: It calculates the ticket amount based on the recorded speed. If the speed exceeds the limit, it categorizes the speeding violation into different levels and calculates the corresponding ticket amount.

4. Alcohol Test Function: It calculates the ticket amount based on the alcohol level in the driver's blood. Depending on the recorded speed and alcohol level, it categorizes the violation into different levels and calculates the corresponding ticket amount.

5. Ticket Calculation: It computes the total ticket amount by summing the speeding ticket amount and the alcohol-related ticket amount.

6. File Writing: It writes the driver's name, total ticket amount, details of the ticket (including speeding and alcohol ticket amounts), and the time of ticket provision into a text file. The file name includes the driver's name.

7. Error Handling: The code does not contain explicit error handling for invalid inputs or exceptions.

Overall, this code simulates a scenario where a driver's speed and alcohol levels are tested, and tickets are issued accordingly. It calculates the total ticket amount and records the details in a text file for documentation purposes.
